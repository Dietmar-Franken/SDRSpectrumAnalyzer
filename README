RTLSpectrumAnalyzer creates a spectrum analyzer from a RTL2832 based DVB dongle.

Usage
-----

Set the start and end frequency and step size, all in hertz. Then start recording data for either the first or second series.

This RTLSpectrumAnalyzer was created with the objective of finding the frequencies being generated by a signal source, whether that's from a mobile phone, a bug or from the human body being generated from what is now known as electronic harassment.

The first series should be recorded reasonably far away from the signal source and the second closer.

The frequency strength of the signal source should be a lot stronger when nearer the antenna. Other sources of frequencies such as television and radio should be essentially constant since they are a lot further away.

It's this that facilitates finding the frequency of a signal source.

The difference in the signal strengths can also be graphed and a threshold set to only show those frequencies that are stronger by that amount.

The average of the recorded signals is used since this has a significant effect on improving the clarity of the data.
